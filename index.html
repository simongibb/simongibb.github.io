   <h2>Five Facts About Ferrets</h2>
   <h3>Read time: 3 minutes</h3>
   <main>
    <p>
      Ferrets when happy, exicted or playful will make a dooking sound which sounds like laughter, however with sounds like hissing 
      it can mean they're scared or angry but can also hiss when play fighting so context and body lanuage is important, if they are screaching 
      take it seriously as it is not a good sound to hear as it can mean they are in pain, in danger, or extremely fearful about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "ferret" can be traced back to the Latin"furittus," which means "little thief." ferrets are known
      for stealing items they can get their paws on and will try very hard to steal whatever item they see so ensure that your
      itens are placed somewhere that they can't get to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When it gets to the mating season, female ferrets will die if they do not mate however male ferrets won't be at risk of dying 
      if they don't mate, keep in mind that if ferrets aren't neutered it will leave a horrible smell, so if you don't intend on bredding ferrets
      or wanting your ferrets to have kits get them neutered.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ferrets have a life span of 6-10 years. 
    </p>
    <p>
  Ferrets can get lonely so it's recomeded getting more than 1 ferret as they are sociable animals, if you have other household pets like a cat or dog
  intorduce them slowly and carfully. ensure to supervise when they are playing.
